## How does it work?

Cosmic is an easy-to-use game launcher, written in C# for Windows. You don't need any coding experience, or even to open the source code, to program it to work with your game.

You can add a landing page to the launcher (e.g. latest patch notes) to keep your players informed or even just show off the game a little bit more. (Who hates intrusive advertisements anyway?)
